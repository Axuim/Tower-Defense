{"name":"Tower Defense","tagline":"Reddit Challenge Friday - Week 1","body":"Made for the first Reddit Challenge Friday.\r\n\r\nI tried to write the code in such a way as to be extendable and to leverage many techniques that most Unity devs don't seems to use (delegates, event driven ui, static classes, etc.).  Some of these techniques aren't necessarily in the most ideal of locations but I mostly wanted to demo their usage.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about how I did something or why I did something a certain way feel free to ask.\r\n\r\nWeb Player can be found [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35006950/Tower%20Defense/index.html).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
